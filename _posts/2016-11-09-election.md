The night is so long. "I feel unsafe even when studying for my midterm tomorrow." A guy I met on the elevator said.  

Well, things will usually neither be as good, nor as bad as we expected. To anyone who happened to get to this post, take care. The sun will rise tomorrow morning, and don't forget to enjoy the rest of tonight.
